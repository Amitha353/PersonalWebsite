                Electronic commerce is a commercial transaction that
                involves the process of buying and selling goods, services and
                transfer of information between businesses and customers
                over an electronic medium. Electronic commerce has
                expanded rapidly and continues to grow at an unforeseen rate.
                With the advent of e-commerce, the potential fraudulent
                activities are prevalent, and therefore hundreds of millions of
                dollars are lost to fraud every year. The goal of this paper is to
                implement and evaluate several anomaly detection methods
                for making predictions using, or finding patterns in,
                heterogeneous e-commerce data to detect fraudulent activities
                of users. Various Machine Learning algorithms – K-nearest
                neighbors, Random-Forest and Isolated forest algorithms are
                employed to train the model in order to detect fraud and
                anomalous techniques in e-commerce.

                Bitcoin is an established cryptographic digital currency whose
                value lays in the computational complexity rather than a
                physical commodity. Bitcoin is an open source software
                program with three aspects. (i) Peer-to-Peer network – low
                barrier entry; (ii) Mining – inevitable concentration of power;
                (iii) Software upgrades. The nodes on the network follow a
                decentralized consensus for establishing the value of ledger
                and updating the blockchain which serves as a single source
                of truth for all transactions. As cryptocurrencies are
                developing more compelling utilities, creating ever faster and
                safer payment systems they are shifting the “money
                paradigm”. Bitcoins are an evolution in money and provide a
                unique opportunity to forecast their price unlike the existing
                fiat currencies. The goal of this paper is to implement, train
                and evaluate several machine learning models in order to
                predict the price of the most popular cryptocurrency –
                Bitcoins. The various machine learning algorithms employed
                are – Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Ridge
                Regression, Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, Linear
                Support Vector Machine, and Kernel Support Vector
                Machine.
